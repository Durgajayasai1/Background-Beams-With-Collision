# Beams Collision - Explosion Effect

This Component implements an explosion effect using `CustomPainter` and `AnimationController`.

## Features

- Particle explosion effect on impact
- Animated movement using `AnimationController`
- Customizable particle speed, angle, and radius

## How It Works

1. Generates 20 particles with random speed, angle, and radius
2. Animates the particles outward from the explosion center
3. Uses `CustomPainter` to draw the effect
